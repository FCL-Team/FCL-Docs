### Login Methods

Currently, the following login methods are supported:
- Official Login
- Offline Login
- Third-party Login (skin stations, etc.)

### Official Login (Microsoft Account)

**Please note that logging in with a Microsoft account requires you to have purchased and activated a Minecraft account; otherwise, you will not be able to log in.**

Click the account button in the top right corner, select "Official Login," click "Login," and then you will be redirected to the login page. Paste the device code (it will be automatically copied to the clipboard), click "Next," enter your account password, wait for the confirmation message indicating that everything is set up, and then return to the previous screen to complete the official login.

### Offline Login

Below the Microsoft login button, click "Offline Login." In the pop-up interface, enter an ID consisting of 3-16 characters. **Note that spaces should be replaced with underscores, and only numbers, letters, and underscores are supported in newer versions.** Click "Login" to complete the offline login.

### Third-party Login

Below the Microsoft account button, click "Add Authentication Server." In the interface, enter the address of a supported authentication server. Currently, classic authentication servers include:
- littleSkin (known as a skin station): https://littleskin.cn/api/yggdrasil
- naituskin: https://naituskin.cn/api/yggdrasil

After adding the authentication server, visit the website to create a character, set a password, save it, and then return to the launcher. Select the corresponding authentication server, enter the character ID and password, and click "Login" to complete the third-party login.
