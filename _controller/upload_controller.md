## Controller Review Rules
### Basic Functionality and Design Requirements
**1. Ensure Functional Completeness**: The controller must have core functionalities.
**3. Originality**: Copying or using others' controller styles, layouts, text, or special features without permission is not allowed. If you reference other controller, you must obtain <span style="color: red;">**authorization from the original author**</span> and mention the original author in the controller description or controller itself. Be sure to send a screenshot of the authorization proof in the review group.
**4. No Commercial Promotion**: The content must not include any form of commercial promotion.

### File Upload Requirements
**1. Naming Conventions**: The controller file (eight-character ID <span style="color: red;">compressed package</span>) should be named appropriately, avoiding prohibited words (such as "cheat, invincible, exclusive, surpass the world, strongest", etc.).
**2. Clear Classification**: Ensure that the classification and language fields are filled out completely.
**3. Sample Images**: Screenshots should be directly related to the controller, showing its main appearance rather than too many game screenshots.
**4. Icon Standards**: Icons should maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio and can use personal avatars.
**5. We Recommend Your Controller <span style="color: red;">Meets the Following Requirements</span>**
- The view style should be visually appealing.
- <span style="color: red;">The view style should be original</span>.
- The view placement should be reasonable.
- <span style="color: red;">Views should have diverse functions</span>.
- Include at least two view groups.

### Common Controller Issues and Solutions
**1. Incorrect Image Format or Meaningless**
- Icons (icons) should be close to 1:1 and meaningful.
- Screenshots should show the appearance of the controller, not game screenshots.

**2. Plagiarism and Borrowing Issues**
- Check if there is plagiarism or borrowing from other controllers.
- Check if the original author is credited and authorized.
- Try to ensure it is entirely self-made.

**3. Incorrect File Type**
- Check if the wrong file is uploaded; only upload the eight-character compressed package.
- Do not upload .json files directly.
- Do not rename the eight-character compressed package.
- Do not change the extension of .json files or compress them into ZIP packages for upload.

**4. Suspected Personal Use or Low Quality**
- Do not upload controllers that only suit your personal habits.
- Do not upload low-quality controllers.
- Add more functions and unique features.
- Optimize the appearance of the controller.
- If buttons are misaligned, align them properly for a better layout.
- Do not include "exclusive" in the controller name.

**5. Unqualified View Style**
- Avoid using styles with strange colors, overly bright/dark, excessively transparent/opaque (unless necessary), or non-aesthetic styles.
- Font size should be appropriate, and the layout should be aesthetically pleasing.

**6. Controller Files Being Withdrawn**
- Approved controllers will notify the author, and the controller files in the group files and messages will be withdrawn/deleted for easier review and organization.
- Unqualified controllers will also be withdrawn; please pay attention to the review notifications.

**7. No Response to Review**
- Controller reviews are purely manual, and reviewers may not have time to review immediately.
- Approval does not mean immediate listing in the launcher; please be patient.

**Special Note: Group Rules**
Any unauthorized use of controller styles must be modified for originality before uploading.
This group enforces **strict regulations**:
- Members who do not upload controllers within one day of joining will be removed.
- Multiple accounts joining the group chat are prohibited.
- Idle chatting is prohibited.
