# FCL Key Layout Upload Tutorial and Group Rules

This tutorial will help you understand how to upload custom key layouts through the FCL launcher and review the relevant group rules. After approval, the uploaded layouts can be viewed and downloaded within the launcher. <span style="color: red;">Please read the content carefully; no one will teach you if you make mistakes.</span> <span style="color: green;">Before uploading, please note: Do not upload personal-use key layouts. Only recommend uploading layouts that are designed for the public (users) and will be updated.</span>

## Key Layout Upload
1. Open the launcher, click on the controller icon on the left side to enter the controller page. Select the key layout you want to upload in the left area and click “__Upload Layout__” (not “Share Layout”).

3. In the pop-up window, fill in the controller information and confirm. Choose the language of the key layout and the type of device it is compatible with.
   - Select the key layout icon and screenshot by clicking the button in the red box on the right 
     (If the button disappears, try switching to dark mode).

   > **Note:**
   > - Do not use external apps to select images, as this may cause path errors and sharing failures;
   > - If you cannot find the image path, use a file manager (such as MT) to move the image to a memorable path.

4. After selecting, click the “Share” button. A compressed package named with an eight-character ID (usually a combination of numbers and letters) will be generated automatically. Share the compressed package to the review group and wait for the administrator to complete the review.

## Key Layout Review Rules
### Basic Functionality and Design Requirements
**1. Ensure Functional Completeness**: The key layout must have core functionalities.  
**2. Design Aesthetics**: Use original and visually comfortable styles, avoiding excessive reliance on default designs.  
**3. Originality**: Copying or using others' key layout styles, layouts, text, or special features without permission is not allowed. If you reference other key layouts, you must obtain <span style="color: red;">**authorization from the original author**</span> and mention the original author in the key layout description or layout itself. Be sure to send a screenshot of the authorization proof in the review group.  
**4. No Commercial Promotion**: The content must not include any form of commercial promotion.

### File Upload Requirements
**1. Naming Conventions**: The key layout file (eight-character ID <span style="color: red;">compressed package</span>) should be named appropriately, avoiding prohibited words (such as "cheat, invincible,carry, exclusive, surpass the world, strongest", etc.).  
**2. Clear Classification**: Ensure that the classification and language fields are filled out completely.  
**3. Sample Images**: Screenshots should be directly related to the key layout, showing its main appearance rather than too many game screenshots.  
**4. Icon Standards**: Icons should maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio and can use personal avatars.  
**5. We Recommend Your Key Layout <span style="color: red;">Meets the Following Requirements</span>**
- The key style should be visually appealing.
- <span style="color: red;">The key style should be original</span>.
- The key placement should be reasonable.
- <span style="color: red;">Keys should have diverse functions</span>.
- Include at least two control groups.

### Common Key Layout Issues and Solutions
**1. Incorrect Image Format or Meaningless**
- Icons (icons) should be close to 1:1 and meaningful.
- Screenshots should show the appearance of the key layout, not game screenshots.

**2. Plagiarism and Borrowing Issues**
- Check if there is plagiarism or borrowing from other key layouts.
- Check if the original author is credited and authorized.
- Try to ensure it is entirely self-made.

**3. Incorrect File Type**
- Check if the wrong file is uploaded; only upload the eight-character compressed package.
- Do not upload .json files directly.
- Do not rename the eight-character compressed package.
- Do not change the extension of .json files or compress them into ZIP packages for upload.

**4. Suspected Personal Use or Low Quality**
- Do not upload key layouts that only suit your personal habits.
- Do not upload low-quality key layouts.
- Add more functions and unique features.
- Optimize the appearance of the key layout.
- If buttons are misaligned, align them properly for a better layout.
- Do not include "exclusive" in the key layout name.

**5. Unqualified Key Style**
- Do not use too many default keys (unless required by the theme).
- Avoid using styles with strange colors, overly bright/dark, excessively transparent/opaque (unless necessary), or non-aesthetic styles.
- Font size should be appropriate, and the layout should be aesthetically pleasing.

**6. Key Layout Files Being Withdrawn**
- Approved key layouts will notify the author, and the key layout files in the group files and messages will be withdrawn/deleted for easier review and organization.
- Unqualified key layouts will also be withdrawn; please pay attention to the review notifications.

**7. No Response to Review**
- Key layout reviews are purely manual, and reviewers may not have time to review immediately.
- Approval does not mean immediate listing in the launcher; please be patient.

**Special Note: Group Rules**
Any unauthorized use of key layout styles must be modified for originality before uploading.
This group enforces **strict regulations**:
- Members who do not upload key layouts within one day of joining will be removed.
- Multiple accounts joining the group chat are prohibited.
- Idle chatting is prohibited.
